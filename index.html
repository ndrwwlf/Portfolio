        <p>
            I was born in Minneapolis, grew up in St. Paul, and moved to Montana when I was 14 years old.
            I have worked as a cook ever since I was in High School. 
        <br>
        </p>
            Now I live in Minneapolis again, but I lived in Colorado for nine months last year.
            When I was there I hiked a 12,000 ft mountain.
        <br/>
        <p> It was the most physically diffcult thing I've ever done. 
            There was a rocky stretch along the peak that was very dangerous.
            I was very proud of myself when we got back but it was just another 
            typical overnight camp for my friend that took me.
